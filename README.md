# Simple outlier detector
A simple tool that detects outliers in data using principal component analysis. Provide it with a csv file containing one observation per row. It will create a scatterplot using PCA to help identify outliers in the data.

This is useful in order to sanity check datasets and to find any anomalies that might be worth investigating.
